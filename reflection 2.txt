My expectations for the 2nd Quarter of ICT/TLE this Grade 9 were that I would be able to understand how to use CSS properly. Additionally, I expected to learn the different CSS codes that will help me style web pages more efficiently by controlling the different colors, fonts, layouts, and more. <br> <br>

My expectations were met since I understood how to use CSS effectively. With the knowledge I have learned this quarter, I was able to apply it to my ICT activities like my e-portfolio, hands-on, and others. I also designed my e-portfolio easily with the help of CSS.Â  <br> <br>

In conclusion, I appreciate all the hard work that Ms. Uminga has done to help me and my classmates understand our lessons for 2nd Quarter and for guiding us when we have trouble during discussions. I want to thank her for giving her time to help us learn how to use CSS. I will aim to be motivated to do better this upcoming 3rd quarter. </p>
