<p align="left">
> Events - actions that are triggered either by mouse click, function calls, keyboard strokes, loading of images, submitting an HTML form, etc.
Usually used in connection with functions. <br>
> Functions will not work without a force that will trigger it. You can use event handlers to respond to an event on your page. <br><br>

EVENTS<br>
> Onload and onunload events are triggered when a user enters or exits a web page. Can also be used to store and retrieve cookies. <br><br>

> Cookie - message given to a web browser. <br><br>

> Onload - can be used to check the web browser version type and version. <br><br><br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

~ Onfocus, onblur, onchange - these attributes are often used with the validation of fields in a form. <br>
EX: a user selects a row in a table, through JS, the whole row can be highlighted to give emphasis to the selected row.<br><br>

~ Onsubmit - used to validate all fields in the form before submitting it. <br>

> When the submit button is clicked, it will call a function checkFields(). The function will check all the fields in the form. If everything is cleared, it will return a ‘true’ so the form will be submitted; otherwise, it will return to a ‘false’ so the form will be cancelled. <br><br><br>

~ Onmouseover and onmouseout - usually used for animation purposes. <br><br>

~ Onclick - usually used to connect you to another webpage or to trigger an event call.
<br><br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

> Popup Boxes - windows that pop-out of the screen.<br>
JS has three kinds: alert box, user-input prompt box and confirm box.<br><br>
1. Alert Box - usually used when you want to make sure that the user reads your message such as a warning or a greeting. <br>
SYNTAX: alert(“message”); <br>
<img src="alertt.png" width="500" height="250"><br><br>


2. User-Input Prompt Box- usually used when you want data to be prompted first before the user can enter a page. <br>
SYNTAX: prompt(“message”, “defaultvalue”);<br>
<img src="prompt.png" width="500" height="250"><br><br>

3. Confirm Box - usually used when you want the user to verify or accept something. <br> SYNTAX: confirm(“message”);<br>
<img src="confirm.png" width="500" height="250">
 </p> <br><br><br>


<h2> *Lesson 2* </h2>
<p align="left">
* Conditional Statements - perform different actions for different decisions. <br><br>

> If Statement - used to check or verify a condition and execute a set of statements only if the condition is true. This should be referred as a statement and not as a function. <br>
- One of the most popular and important conditional constructs in JS and in other programming languages. <br>
- Evaluates a condition to True or False. It then runs a specific code depending on the result of this evaluation. <br>
<img src="if.png" width="500" height="250"><br><br>


> Nested If Statement - like an “if statement” with another “if statement”, just like a parent and a child. <br>
- Used when “child” condition is only checked when the parent condition is true. <br><br>
SYNTAX: <br>
if (condition 1) <br>
{ if (condition 2)<br>
{ //set of statements that will be executed }}<br><br>


> If-Else Statement - has also the same format as “if statement” but an Else part is added. <br>
- If the condition satisfies the statement inside an If statement, part of the code will be executed. And Else statement inside Else part only will be executed. <br>
- Giving an alternative instruction in case the arguments isn’t TRUE. <br><br>

SYNTAX:<br>
if (condition)<br>
{//set of statements if condition satisfies}<br>
else<br>
{//set of statements if condition fails}<br>
<img src="if else 1.png" width="300" height="250"><br><br>
<img src="if else 2.png" width="500" height="250"><br><br>


> If Else If Statement - multiple conditions<br>
- statement that depends on another if statement.<br>
- telling the browser that something is True, then do something else, if the other thing is True, then do something else, and so on. <br>
<img src="if else if.png" width="500" height="250"><br><br>


> Switch Statement - used when a condition may have multiple results and a different set of operation is done based on each result or input. <br><br>
SYNTAX<br>
switch(condition)<br>
{ case result1: <br>
//operation for result 1 <br>
Case result2: <br>
//operation for result 2<br>
. <br>
. <br> 
default: <br>
//If result belongs to none of the case specified.}<br>

<h2> *Lesson 3* </h2>
<p align="left">
<b> Conditions, Controls and Loops</b> <br><br>

> Function - self-contained piece of code that performs a particular “function” when it is called and it is also a set of statements or blocks of codes combined together for a particular use, also known as method. <br>
- Usually used so that you will not have to retype your codes again. <br> 
- A function can be called anywhere within the page or even from an external JS file.
<br>

- Defined using the keyword “function” followed by its name and then open and close parentheses. This is known as an argument. <br><br>

> Argument - provides additional information needed by the function to process. <br><br>

SYNTAX: <br>
function <br>
functionname(var1, var2, var3…,varN) <br>
{//Place your codes here} <br><br>

> functionname is the name of the function. <br>
> var1, var2, var3…,VarN are the parameters. <br> 
These are the values that are passed on to the function whenever it is triggered. <br><br>

> Open and close braces are required in functions. A function without parameters should include the open and close parentheses () after the name of the function and remember the function must be in lowercase, otherwise, a JS error will be called. <br><br>

EX OF FUNCTIONS: document.write(), add() and check()<br><br>

document.write() - predefined function<br>
add() and check() - user-defined functions<br><br>

> Variables that are declared within a function will not last outside the function. If you want to save or reuse the value of the variable, you can use a return function. You can also put a return statement in the function so that the value stored while using the function can be returned. <br><br>

Return Statement - functions that give out a value must use the return statement. <br>
