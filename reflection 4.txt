<p align="justify"> 

At the beginning of the 4th Quarter in ICT/TLE, I expected that I would be able to understand how to use JavaScript properly. These expectations were met as I learned about the importance of events, functions, conditional statements, conditions, controls, and loops. Understanding these concepts has helped me to make web pages more interactive and creative while also being able to gather information from users. <br><br>

In conclusion, I would like to thank Mrs. Uminga for guiding me through these lessons and helping me improve my coding skills. </p>
