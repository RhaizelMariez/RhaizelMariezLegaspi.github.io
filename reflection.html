<p align="justify"> My expectations for the 1st quarter of ICT/TLE this Grade 9 was that I would easily understand the topics that Ms. Uminga taught me and I would be familiar with the different HTML codes. I also expect that the HTML codes would help me to efficiently create my own website for future school projects.<br><br>

My expectations were met, and I gained new knowledge about coding. I was able to practice my coding skills this quarter with all the performance tasks, hands-on, and other activities we had for ICT, even though I couldn't recall some of the codes. As a result, I practiced coding at home so that I may fully improve my coding skills in the future.<br><br>

In conclusion, I would like to thank my teacher in ICT/TLE, Ms. Uminga, for being a good teacher, as she helped me to understand the lessons well, and I will strive to study harder this upcoming 2nd quarter.</p>
